  # The labels by which incoming alerts are grouped together. For example,
  # multiple alerts coming in for cluster=A and alertname=LatencyHigh would
  # be batched into a single group.

  # To aggregate by all possible labels use '...' as the sole label name.
  # This effectively disables aggregation entirely, passing through all

  # its own grouping. Example: group_by: [...]
  group_by: [...]

  # When a new group of alerts is created by an incoming alert, wait at

  # firing shortly after another are batched together on the first
